Users may order one or more pizzas, where each pizza may be either: small, medium or large. Small pizzas cost $5, medium pizzas cost $8 and large pizzas cost $12. All pizzas come on a tomato base and will have the topping cheese by default, at no extra cost
Users may choose up to a maximum of four additional toppings 
 from the following list, where each topping adds an additional $1 to the price of the pizza:
• Bacon,
• Olives,
• Ham,
• Mushrooms,
• Pineapple,
• Salami,
• Anchovies.
A pizza order consists of an order for one or more pizzas, where each pizza has a size, and may optionally include a list of up to four additional toppings.
Each pizza order must be marked as either to be collected or to be delivered.
If the pizza is to be collected, then the order requires a name and a phone number to be valid.
If the pizza is to be delivered then a name, phone number and address are required to be valid. In addition, if the order total is less than $30 then an $8 delivery fee is added to the total. The application must be error tolerant and displaying an order summary which include details of all orders, including:
• The details of each pizza in the order,
• The total cost of the order, and
• The name, phone number and (if required) address of the person who made the order
